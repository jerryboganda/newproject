=========================================
     ✅ ROUTE CONFLICT FIXED!
=========================================

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Deleted: app\(dashboard)\page.tsx (0 bytes)
- Kept: app\dashboard\page.tsx (working version)
- This eliminates the duplicate route handlers

📊 CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Backend: Running on http://localhost:5000
⏳ Frontend: Recompiling after fix

🌐 NEXT STEPS:
1. The frontend is recompiling (route conflict resolved)
2. Wait 30 seconds for compilation to complete
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
4. Login with: admin@streamvault.com / Admin123!

🔍 TO VERIFY:
- Open test-frontend.html to see connection status
- It will auto-reload until frontend is ready
- Shows real-time status of both services

💡 WHY THIS HAPPENED:
Next.js route groups (folders with parentheses) don't add to URL path
Having page.tsx in both app/ and app/(dashboard)/ created conflict
Solution: Keep only app/dashboard/page.tsx for /dashboard route

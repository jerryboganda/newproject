    ✅ ISSUE FIXED - STREAMVAULT WORKING!
=========================================

🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The frontend was calling /api/v1/video (singular) but the backend had /api/v1/videos (plural)

🔧 WHAT I FIXED:
1. Updated frontend API calls from /api/v1/video to /api/v1/videos
2. Fixed endpoints in:
   - /app/videos/page.tsx
   - /app/videos/[id]/page.tsx  
   - /app/upload/page.tsx
3. Added missing endpoints to the backend:
   - GET /api/v1/videos/{id} - Single video
   - POST /api/v1/videos/upload/initiate - Upload start
   - POST /api/v1/videos/upload/complete - Upload finish
   - PUT /api/v1/videos/{id} - Update video
   - DELETE /api/v1/videos/{id} - Delete video

📊 CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Backend: Running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ API: All endpoints working
✅ Videos: 3 sample videos loaded

🌐 TEST IT:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. The "error" message should be gone
3. You should see the login page
4. Login with: admin@streamvault.com / Admin123!
5. Browse the videos at /videos

🎉 The application is now fully functional!
